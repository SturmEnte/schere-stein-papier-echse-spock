# Schere Stein Papier Echse Spock

## About

This is a project that I created during class. It is an extention of the popular game "rock-paper-scissors" and the game name can be translated to "rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock".

The game is very simple and I didn't add any fancy animations

## Notice

The reasons for winning, loosing or tieing (is that a word?) are not programmed in yet
